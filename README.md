## Requirements

- **Window & Title** - A 800x600 pixel window with a title.
- **basic environment** - I will create pixelated bones/minicats falling down the screen.
- **pet character** - this is based on the user's choice but I will create a cat using pygame.

Written explanation:  
In this challenge, I'll develop a virtual pet with whom to engage. To do so, I will use Visual Studio Code to create a virtual environment and character. The virtual environment will implement what was learned in "Digital Rain" to create a background for the pet to move around on. 

  The repository does not contain any external files, such as images, that must be imported. The project.py file is the only one available, and I will work completely on that. Some of the qualities that should be highlighted are the character's limitations. To avoid losing the character, I have implemented a prograam that will ensure that the character can not be moved beyond the screen boundary. Another bonus is the digital pet itself, which showcases my creativity.
